# EEG Relaxation Analyzer  

This project analyzes and visualizes EEG alpha waves (8–12 Hz) related to relaxation.  
It uses open data from the PhysioNet database (file: S001R01.edf) and the MNE-Python library  
to extract frequency bands and plot alpha wave activity.  

## Overview  
- **Signal type:** EEG  
- **Focus:** Alpha waves (8–12 Hz)  
- **Goal:** Detect and visualize brain relaxation patterns  
- **Tools:** Python, MNE, Matplotlib  

## Files  
- `EEG relaxation Analyzer.ipynb` → Full report with figures and analysis  
- `S001R01.edf` → Sample EEG data  

## Interpretation  
The analysis shows a clear alpha band peak (8–12 Hz), typical of a relaxed mental state  
with closed eyes and minimal cognitive effort.
